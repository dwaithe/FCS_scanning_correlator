def autocorrelate(a, m=16, deltat=1, normalize=False,

    """ 
    Autocorrelation of a 1-dimensional sequence on a log2-scale.
    
    This computes the correlation according to 
    :py:func:`numpy.correlate` for positive :math:`k`  on a base 2
    logarithmic scale.

        numpy.correlate(a, a, mode="full")[len(a)-1:]  

        :math:`z_k = \Sigma_n a_n a_{n+k}`


    Note that only the correlation in the positive direction is
    computed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        input sequence of real numbers
    m : even integer
        defines the number of points on one level, must be an
        even integer
    deltat : float
        distance between bins
    normalize : bool
        normalize the result to the square of the average input
        signal and the factor `M-k`.
    copy : bool
        copy input array, set to False to save memory
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in 
        which the elements are summed.  By default, the dtype of 
        `a` is used.


    Returns
    -------
    autocorrelation : ndarray
        Nx2 array containing lag time and autocorrelation


    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm computes the correlation with the convention of the
    curve decaying to zero.
    
    For experiments like e.g. fluorescence correlation spectroscopy,
    the signal can be normalized to `M-k` by invoking:
    
           normalize = True

    For emulating the numpy.correlate behavior on a logarithmic
    scale (default behavior) use:

           normalize = False
